# Angel

### About

Angel is a virtual assistant made in python. Recently I've been wondering if I could make a simple virtual assistant on my own. I looked at my Alexa and wondered if it would be too hard to do this or not. I decided to accept this challenge and started coding. The first version of Anegel is complete, being composed of a limited amount of commands that can be made to her.

### Possible Commands

*"Angel, hello"*

*"Angel, who are you?"*

*"Angel, how are you?"*

*"Angel, search for 'harry potter'"*

*"Angel, search on youtube for 'minecraft'"*

*"Angel, what time is it?"*

*"Angel, open google"*

*"Angel, open youtube"*

*"Angel, open facebook"*

*"Angel, open instagram"*

*"Angel, open twitter"*

*"Angel, open spotify"*

*"Angel, open netflix"*

*"Angel, open twitch"*

*"Angel, what is 'pineaple'"*

*"Angel, expecto patronum"*

*"Angel, play '24 from sundial'"*

*"Angel, what's the weather in 'campinas'?"*

*"Angel, fin location 'campinas'"*

*"Angel, goodbye"*

### Details

* If you go to line 174 you can change your name which by default is "Felipe" (my name) so that Angel refers to you by your name, not mine.
* Angel will only answer you if you refer to her by her name (Angel). Any phrase you speak while she is being executed by the terminal will be ignored.

### What did I use?

* Python 3.9.2
* VirtualEnv 20.4.7
* All the other dependencies are already written in requirement1.txt and requirement2.txt

### How to use?

* First of all, you need python3. [Click Here](https://www.python.org/), download and install it.
* Secondly you need to clone this repository. Go to a safe directory end type:

  ````bash
  git clone git@github.com:felipolis/Angel.git
  ````
* After that, you need to install all the packages i've used. On your project directory, open your command prompt and type these lines:

  ````bash
  pip install -r requirements1.txt
  pipwin install -r requirements2.txt
  ````
* Now you can run the program: `python bot.py`
